This is a project of the MGTA451 course.

It used raw data scrapped from Airbnb website to generate a Shiny App which enables housing resourse holders to get an suggested price, based on housing related attributes like location, housing type etc.


# To check out the model, open Airbnb_Shiny.Rmd in rstudio and install the following packages first:
dplyr, readr, ggplot2, VIM, shiny

After clicking 'run all chunks', you will be able to interact with the shiny App interface to explore the prices around your neighborhood, as well as generate a recommend price for your house as reference! :)
